        Hypotheses for House Sale Prices
        These hypotheses are based on the observed correlations and provide 
        insights 
        into key factors influencing house sale prices during data 
        visualization.\n

        Hypothesis 1: Overall Quality\n
        - **Hypothesis**: Quality significantly impacts selling price.\n
        - **Explanation**: Strong correlation; higher quality
         commands higher prices.\n

        Hypothesis 2: Above Ground Living Area\n
        - **Hypothesis**: Living area affects selling price.\n
        - **Explanation**: Robust positive correlation; larger spaces 
        mean higher prices. \n

        Hypothesis 3: Year Built
        - **Hypothesis**: Year built moderately impacts price.\n
        - **Explanation**: Moderate positive correlation; newer 
        houses command higher prices.\n

        Hypothesis 4: Garage Area\n
        - **Hypothesis**: Garage size plays a role.\n
        - **Explanation**: Strong correlation; larger garages 
        mean higher selling prices.\n

        f"Overall, by analyzing these correlations and considering the top "
        f"correlated variables, we have confirmed our hypotheses that the "
        f"quality of the house and the size of the property and addition of a"
        f"garage play significant"
        f"roles in determining the sale price. Additionally, newer houses tend"
        f" to command higher prices compared to older ones. The correlation "
        f" This makes sense because newer houses are often of higher quality "
        f" coefficients and visualizations provide robust evidence to support"
        f" these findings."
