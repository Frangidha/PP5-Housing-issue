## Introduction

This Machine Learning Project was developed as the fifth portfolio project during the Code Institute's Diploma in Full Stack Development. It covers the Predictive Analytics specialization.

The Machine Learning, Data Analysis toolkit & neural networks are applied to a real estate dataset with the specific purpose of allowing a user to predict the sale value of a property based on certain features of the home. It also allows the user to see how certain features of a home correlate with the sale price of the home.
